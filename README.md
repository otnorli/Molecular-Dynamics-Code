Molecular Dynamics Program

Many body simulation of Argon atoms in a box. Handles solid, liquid and gas states of Argon.

Makes use of:
- Periodic boundary conditions
- Lennard-Jones potential 
- Thermostats
- Optimizations, such as force calculation screening
- Porousity

Can calculate:
- Temperatures
- Potential energies
- Kinetic energies
- Medium distance between atoms
- Various other physical properties
